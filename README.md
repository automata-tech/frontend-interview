# How to start

You will need two terminal windows to run this exercise, one to run the server and one for the FE application.

1. In project root run `pnpm install`
2. In terminal one run `pnpm run server`
3. In terminal two run `pnpm run dev`
4. Do your best attempt while trying to stay within the hour
5. On the `dev` branch there's a whole list of issues and pointers, code is also annotated with comments.
